        <h3 center>The goal and theme of this project is to make a website that is viable to use in a fighting gym.
            And what this shows is a website to sign up for the gym membership or just learn about it in general.
            With the main problem being only having a rough draft of what the website is suppose to look like.
            As the main ones that would be using this website is the staff obviously and a wide range of people as well from long time athletes to beginners
            they can also be young or old as there are plenty of different types of people that go into gyms.
            Ultimately the desired outcome of this is to provide an alternate channel to become a member of the gym and also just learn about the organizations as well.
